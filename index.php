            <h3>About me</h3>
            
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Southern Colorado and while growing up at home I 
                    learned how to be a leader participating in sports. For a decade I played 
                    hockey as a goalie, guarding the net and shouting callouts to my teammates 
                    on the ice. I learned how to win and lose playing hockey which provided me 
                    with the precious skill of controlling my emotions. This skill became polished 
                    later in my sporting career when I started shooting archery. Archery is a highly 
                    disciplined sport. To perform well I mastered controlling my body fully; emotionally, 
                    physically, and mentally. And after a few years of shooting, I became a Level 1 
                    Certified Coach. While I do not currently coach due to college, I was a private 
                    coach with a small team. In high school, I was commended for my dedication to 
                    higher achievement with an honors STEM certificate.

                </p>
            
            <p>
                From a very young age I have been enticed with electronics. The portable gaming consoles like the GameBoy Advance and the DS 
                systems sparked a love for gaming and electronics that has stuck with me. I spent my time in college honing my programming skills 
                as well as learning about different programming paradigms. Throughout my experiences in college I have always felt the want to create 
                something new and exciting, but I always fumble trying to find the precise spot where creativity and programming logic overlap to mold something 
                special. I want to create that feeling of excitement and wonder for what is next for a gamer, similar to a feeling I had when exploring 
                the world of Pokemon Fire Red as a child. <br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                    On my free time I enjoy playing games such as Counter Strike 2, Elden ring, The God of War series, The Yakuza Series, and Stardew Valley.
