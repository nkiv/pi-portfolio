                  I have been coding for over a decade, starting in a middle
                  school coding club where we made games in Xcode. In high
                  school I learned Java and cracked coding challenges on{" "}
                  <a href="codingbat.com">codingbat.com</a>. I went on to major
                  in Computer Science, gaining exposure to a wide range of
                  languages and paradigms such as Python, JavaScript, Scala. As
                  well as learning core topics like algorithms, distributed
                  systems, and programming language development.

                  For the past year post-grad I have focused on learning React
                  and Node to build web applications that are fast, scalable,
                  and user friendly. When I am not exploring new coding
                  concepts, I am tinkering with servers on Raspberry Pi or
                  experimenting with game development using Phaser.js and
