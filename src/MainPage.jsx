      <h3>About me</h3>

      <p>
        I was born and raised in Southern Colorado and while growing up at home
        I learned how to be a leader participating in sports. For a decade I
        played hockey as a goalie, guarding the net and shouting callouts to my
        teammates on the ice. I learned how to win and lose playing hockey which
        provided me with the precious skill of controlling my emotions. This
        skill became polished later in my sporting career when I started
        shooting archery. Archery is a highly disciplined sport. To perform well
        I mastered controlling my body fully; emotionally, physically, and
        mentally. And after a few years of shooting, I became a Level 1
        Certified Coach. While I do not currently coach due to college, I was a
        private coach with a small team. In high school, I was commended for my
        dedication to higher achievement with an honors STEM certificate.
        <br />

      <p>
        From a very young age I have been enticed with electronics. The portable
        gaming consoles like the GameBoy Advance and the DS systems sparked a
        love for gaming and electronics that has stuck with me. I spent my time
        in college honing my programming skills as well as learning about
        different programming paradigms. Throughout my experiences in college I
        have always felt the want to create something new and exciting, but I
        always fumble trying to find the precise spot where creativity and
        programming logic overlap to mold something special. I want to create
        that feeling of excitement and wonder for what is next for a gamer,
        similar to a feeling I had when exploring the world of Pokemon Fire Red
        as a child. <br />

      <p>
        On my free time I enjoy playing games such as Counter Strike 2, Elden
        ring, The God of War series, The Yakuza Series, and Stardew Valley.
