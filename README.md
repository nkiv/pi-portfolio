# Welcome to my portfolio

### This website began as a CS project, I then wanted to serve it to the web and have been building upon it ever since. It is served to the web using Cloudflare tunnels and Apache.

### This is getting its own github because I needed a portable solution to work on the website. It simply is too hard/slow to get vscode server running on the rpi each time I want to make changes, now I can work on my laptop and git pull the changes when I am back near the raspberry pi

### The new react branch is being built up to replace the current and slow loading php webserver with a react.js webserver. Its currently in its skeleton phase as I translate the html into jsx.

### The website is also getting a CSS revamp and hopefully is much more polished to give me an edge over others looking for a software job

### The react branch is being merged, once I get back to the server I can update the live website.
